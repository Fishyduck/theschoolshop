The discography of American rapper Playboi Carti consists of two studio albums, two extended plays (EPs), four mixtapes, one promotional single, and 27 singles (including 11 as a featured artist). Under the alias Sir Cartier, he began his career by self‑releasing three mixtapes: THC: The High Chronical (2011), Young Misfit (2012), and Sensation (2013). These early works helped shape his experimental sound and laid the foundation for his rise in the underground rap scene.

In 2015, Carti gained widespread attention with the viral success of his singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti" (featuring Dash and Maxo Kream), released on SoundCloud. The buzz surrounding these tracks led to his signing with Interscope Records and ASAP Mob's AWGE imprint in 2016. His commercial breakthrough came in April 2017 with the release of his self‑titled debut mixtape, Playboi Carti. The mixtape peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard 200, driven by the success of the single "Magnolia," which reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Another hit from the mixtape, "Wokeuplikethis" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, charted on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Carti’s debut studio album, Die Lit, was released in May 2018. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, earning 61,000 album‑equivalent units in its first week. Praised for its innovative approach to trap music, the album included the platinum‑certified track "Shoota," featuring Lil Uzi Vert, which peaked at number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following a two‑year hiatus, Carti returned with the single "@ Meh" in April 2020, which debuted at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100. His highly anticipated second studio album, Whole Lotta Red, was released in December 2020. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 100,000 album‑equivalent units in its first week, marking Carti's first number‑one album. The project featured notable tracks such as "Go2DaMoon" featuring Kanye West, which peaked at number 30 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and "Sky", which gained widespread acclaim and popularity.

In May 2021, Carti was featured on Trippie Redd’s single "Miss the Rage", which debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned platinum certification. Later that year, he appeared on Kanye West’s "Off the Grid" alongside Fivio Foreign, a track from West's Donda album that was widely celebrated. In February 2024, Carti collaborated with Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign on the single "Carnival", alongside Rich the Kid. The track, part of the collaborative album Vultures 1, marked Carti's first number‑one song on the Billboard Hot 100. Carti has countlessly teased his third upcoming studio album titled I Am Music, which has been in development hell for years.
