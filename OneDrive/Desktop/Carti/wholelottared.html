      <summary>Background and Release</summary>
      <p>
        Whole Lotta Red is the second studio album by American rapper Playboi Carti. It was released on December 25, 2020 by AWGE and Interscope Records. The album consists of 24 tracks and features guest appearances from Kanye West, Kid Cudi, and Future. West served as the executive producer for the album, contributing to its overall production and appearing on the track "Go2DaMoon". The primary production was handled by F1lthy and Art Dealer, alongside additional contributions from Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, Lil 88, Jasper Harris, Ojivolta, Wheezy, and others. Recording for the album began in late 2018 and concluded in November 2020, serving as the follow-up to Carti’s debut studio album, Die Lit (2018).

      <summary>Composition</summary>
      <p>
        Whole Lotta Red showcases an evolution in Carti's sound. The album features a shift from his signature "baby voice" to a more aggressive, hard-hitting delivery. Its production is marked by abrasive, experimental beats and unconventional song structures. Critics note that the album's raw energy and frenetic vocal styling define its character, with producers such as F1lthy, Art Dealer, and Pi'erre Bourne creating a distinctive modern trap sound.

      <summary>Artwork and Aesthetic</summary>
      <p>
        The cover art for Whole Lotta Red was unveiled on December 22, 2020, and designed by Jung "Art Dealer" Chung. It features a black-and-white image of Carti outlined in white, with the word "Red" prominently displayed in bold red letters. The design pays homage to a 1970s punk-rock magazine cover and incorporates heavy metal and gothic influences. This visual aesthetic, along with the accompanying merchandise, complements the album's dark, rebellious themes and Carti's persona as a vampire rock star.

      <summary>Promotion</summary>
      <p>
        Promotion for Whole Lotta Red began well before its release. On April 16, 2020, Carti released the single "@ Meh", which peaked at number 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Its music video was released on the same day and was co-directed by Carti and Nick Walker. In the days leading up to the album’s release, Carti teased additional collaborations with artists like Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott, and Future. The album was officially announced after a brief social media hiatus on November 23, 2020.
