      <summary>Background and Recording</summary>
      <p>
        I Am Music is the upcoming third studio album by American rapper Playboi Carti. It is scheduled to be released through AWGE and Interscope Records. The album follows his previous project, Whole Lotta Red (2020). Following the success of Whole Lotta Red, Carti quickly began teasing new music. On March 10, 2021, he hinted at a new project on Instagram, and by August 23, 2021, he revealed the album’s initial title, Narcissist, setting a tentative release date for September 13—which ultimately passed without a release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time went on, Carti’s plans evolved. In an April 2022 interview with XXL, he mentioned that the album’s title had changed to Music. Throughout 2022 and 2023, he continued recording and experimenting with new sounds, and on December 25, 2022, he posted what appeared to be new cover art on Instagram. In November 2023, Carti emphasized that this album was his most important work to date—revealing that much of it was recorded in a cave-like studio in Paris. Shortly thereafter, he even revealed production from Kanye West.

      <p>
        The promotional campaign for I Am Music began on December 7, 2023, when Carti posted a cryptic Instagram story declaring, "I am music," followed by Pharrell Williams’ response, "Prepare." DJ Akademiks later announced that the album was expected to drop in January 2024. However, the album did not release that month.
      </p>
      <p>
        On December 8, 2023, Carti released the song "Different Day" via the Opium Instagram account, accompanied by a full-length music video. Over the following weeks, he dropped a series of promotional singles—including "2024," "H00dByAir," "Backr00ms" (featuring Travis Scott), "EvilJ0rdan," and "Ketamine"—each paired with a music video. Throughout 2024, he continued teasing snippets of new material during live performances, including previews of "All Red" and "Fuck on My DJ." On September 12, 2024, Carti announced new merchandise that featured the album title and hinted at its release date. Later that day, he posted a teaser for the single "All Red," which was released at midnight.
